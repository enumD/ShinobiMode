# Which one?  
The camper is outside: sun, rain and atmosferic agent represent an hard environment.  
PIR sensors suffer (src chatgpt):  
**Direct sunlight**: can cause a lot of false positives or false negatives because the sunlight can interfere with the sensor‚Äôs ability to distinguish between the heat emitted by a person and the heat of surrounding objects (such as the ground or the vehicle).   
**Thermal Interference**:In some cases, a hot surface (like a sun-heated car or camper) can emit enough infrared radiation that the PIR sensor can't distinguish it from a person, leading to incorrect readings.  

PIR sensors suffer a lot with direct sunligth, i can install the sensors on the external roof of the camper and point them down the sides, this could reduce the possibility to have direct sunlight throught them.  
Another option could be to install the sensors under the camper, under the bumper or better inside the bumper like the car's professional ones. With the microwave sensor maybe i can directly place them behind the bumper to make them not visible at all.
My choice is going in the direction of the microwave sensor:

## RCWL-0516 (Microwave Sensor)  
![Sensor specs](https://github.com/enumD/PeopleRecognition/blob/main/picture/RCWL_0516_specs.png)  

### Pinout  
The RCWL0516 module is a single breakout board with the following connections:  
**3V3** : it is the "output" from the onboard 3.3V regulator which can be used to power external circuits. Remember, this is not an input pin. This pin can provide up to 100mA of current.  
**GND** : is the ground pin.  
**OUT** : is the 3.3V TTL logic output. This pin goes HIGH for 2seconds when a motion is detected and goes LOW when no motion is detected. The output of this module is "analog" and can be connected to an analog input of a microcontroller and sampled by an ADC. The output voltage is roughly proportional to the distance between the sensor and the object.   
**VIN** : provides power to the module. Connect this pin to an input voltage anywhere between 4 to 28V (however, 5V is commonly used). This module consumes less than 3mA of current so, you can easily power this by the 5V output from an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.  
**CDS** : pins are where you attach an optional LDR (light dependent resistor) allowing it to operate only in the dark.  

![Sensor specs](https://github.com/enumD/PeopleRecognition/blob/main/picture/RCWL_0516_specs_02.png)  

### Specs  
The MMBR941M RF amplifier is a high-speed NPN transistor "Q1" that takes low-power RF signal and boosts it to a higher power level. The antenna is integrated on the PCB. It has a detection range of approximately "7 Meters" while only consuming less than "3mA of current". When triggered, the output (OUT) pin will switches from LOW (0V) to HIGH (3.3V) for 2 to 3 seconds before returning to its idle (LOW) state.  
The transistor Q1 also acts as a mixer that combines the transmitted and received signal and outputs the difference which is filtered by the low pass filter formed by C9 and R8, and is amplified by the IC.   

### Jumper Tuning  
![Sensor specs](https://github.com/enumD/PeopleRecognition/blob/main/picture/RCWL_0516_specs_03.png)  

The module has 3 jumper settings at the back of it. The sensors default settings can be altered, by populating these jumpers with appropriate resistors and capacitors:  

**C-TM** : (Pulse length Adjustment) By installing a suitable SMD capacitor you can adjust the repeat trigger time by extending the output pulse length. Default trigger time is 2s. Increasing capacitor's capacity will make repeat trigger time longer. A 0.2¬µF capacitor extends the output pulse to 50s, while 1¬µF extends it to 250s.  
**R-GN** : (Detection Range Adjustment) By installing a suitable resistor you can reduce the detection range. The default detection range is 7m. If you install a 1M resistor the distance reduces to 5m, while a 270K resistor reduces it to 1.5m.  
**R-CDS** : (Light Sensitivity Adjustment) You can use this as an alternative to soldering the LDR. Any resistor between 47K ‚Äì 100K will suffice. The lower the value, the brighter the light must be in order to disable the trigger.  Not needed

Here are two images, the first with two sensors with 2.5 m range and the other with one sensor with 3.6 m range: camper size is 2,2 m wide and 5.62 m long

![2500 mm](https://github.com/enumD/PeopleRecognition/blob/main/picture/2500mm.png)  

![3600 mm](https://github.com/enumD/PeopleRecognition/blob/main/picture/3600.png)  

To obtain these ranges i should use 500 KOhm for 2.5 m and a 720KOhm for 3.6 m. 
The distance between object and sensor could be determined by reading the voltage value for the OUT pin. Higher pin means closer object? I should buy one and try it
